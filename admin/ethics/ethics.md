# Ethics

## Two streams of data collection from users:

### Standard traffic (https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9212670?hl=en&ref_topic=9303476)
* Data collected:
  * Acquisition: how you acquire traffic to your site or app
  * Engagement: user engagement by events, pages, and screens
  * Retention: retention by new and returning users, cohorts, and lifetime value
  * Demographics: categorizes your users by age, location, interests, and more
  * Tech: user adoption of app releases and the technologies used to engage your content
* Ethics review process:
  * Upfront-ness of the consent (and what we do with the data) determines the risk pathway we will take. E.g. in the last page of 20 pages of docs, then higher risk pathway
* Factors to consider:
  * How identifiable this data is, to an IP address
* [Culturomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culturomics) - "Culturomics is a form of computational lexicology that studies human behavior and cultural trends through the quantitative analysis of digitized texts"

### Standard traffic who also provide feedback
* Data collected:
  * Name
  * Contact (email)
  * Feedback:
    * "What was the impact on you?"
    * Is this a useful exercise of our time?
* Ethics review process:
  * Easy waiver of consent
* Factors to consider:
  * What we do with the information
  * How obvious we want the consent form to be
