# Threatened Australians (threatened.org.au)

**NOTE: This repository details the analysis that produces the data in our database. We will be releasing the code behind the web app in another repo sometime in the near future.**

The [Threatened Australians](https://www.threatened.org.au/) project was born out of a recognition that Australian species are in a disastrous state and without better support, they will continue to decline. Australians and their elected representatives can provide that support by talking about it. If we talk about it, we can start to encourage those in power to do what they can to provide the necessary solutions.

We felt the lack of a conversation around the Australian threatened species crisis was, in part, due to a lack of basic information at the fingertips of all Australians. This project is an attempt at providing an accessible and engaging resource that helps to communicate the ongoing crisis.

## Overview
Start with the R Markdown files found in the `doc` directory. The `*.r` files found in the project directory are the corresponding scripts. `/scripts` is where multiple `.r` and `.py` scripts that scrape and request the required data for `*.r` files come from.

*The `/data` and `/output` directories are sparse as most data is in large files. We'll be putting all data up on an institutional repo soon. In the meantime, the `.Rmd` files detail where to get all raw data.*
